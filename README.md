## Hey, you there!

> I am different, but everyone is.

I am Ilay Hamer (Hamer translates to hammer 🔨), a 13 year old programmer 🧑🏽‍💻 living in the Netherlands.

Currently, I am working 💪🏼 on my [personal site](https://www.ilayhamer.com) (It is in dutch only for now 🙁) that I am building 👷🏽 with React.js.

If you want to reach 🙋🏼‍♂️ out to me, contact me at contact@ilayhamer.com.
